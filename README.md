**Grass Simulator** is a web-based simulation of grass, built using **three.js** and **webgl**. This project demonstrates how to create interactive simulations with webgl shaders in threejs. The simulation visualizes grass behaviour on wind flow over time, with customizable parameters for ground height, ground width, number of grass blades, wind speed, ground visibility and grass randomness.
